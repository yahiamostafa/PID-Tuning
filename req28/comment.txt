i've changed the value of alpha to be greater than the old value the old value is equal =31/53 
and the new value is equal = 1/2 . and The result is that the max overshoot decreased from 21.4% 
to 19.6% , that's because When the Phase lead increases the max overshoot decreases .
The old Values:
Kc = 1.2423
alpha = 31/53
max overshoot = 25.2%
ess Step = 0
ess ramp = 8.495e-3
ess parobla = INf
zero = 62
pole = 106


The new Values:
Kc = 1.16
alpha = 1/2
max overshoot = 18.2%
ess Step = 0
ess ramp = 9.937e-3
ess parobla = INf
zero = 50
pole = 100
