Be:
The max overshoot in matlab is 25.2% and the max overshoot is Simulink is 25.9%.
Rise time in matlab is 0.0169 sec and the Rise time in Simulink 16.858 msec.
Peak time in matlab is 0.04 sec and the peak time in simulink is 0.04 sec.
Settling time in matlab is 0.0992 sec and The settling time in simulink is 83.261 msec .
Af:
The max overshoot in matlab is 18.2% and the max overshoot is Simulink is 18.45%.
Rise time in matlab is 0.0188 sec and the Rise time in Simulink 18.621 msec.
Peak time in matlab is 0.042 sec and the peak time in simulink is 0.042 sec.
Settling time in matlab is 0.0957 sec and The settling time in simulink is 79.970 msec .


And after we tune the value the settling time decreases And the rise time increases.
